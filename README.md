# Project Title

NLP with Disaster Tweets Kaggle Mini-Project for course DTSA-5511 Week 4

## Problem Statement

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). The challenge of this Kaggle Mini-project is to use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one's arent.

## Data

The dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ['Data For Everyone'](https://appen.com/pre-labeled-datasets/)
Tweet source: [https://twitter.com/AnyOtherAnnaK/status/629195955506708480](https://twitter.com/AnyOtherAnnaK/status/629195955506708480)

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:
- The text of a tweet.
- A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!).
- The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank).
